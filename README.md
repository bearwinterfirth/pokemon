For Task # 3-4 (Bonus tasks), check out **accuracy.py**

>The testpoints are split into one training list (100 datapoints) and
one testing list (50 points).
The test points are classified as Pichu/Pikachu (using 10-NN)
and the accuracy of the model is calculated by checking how large percentage of
the predictions were actually true.

>This is carried out 10 times, and the mean accuracy is calculated. All results are written to the file **mean_accuracy.txt**.
